Program written by Elhadji Amadou Tour√© '25 | Carleton College for CS 361: Artificial Life and Digital Evolution

This program is a contender for the "mastery" level of the Digital Evolution Assignment

Organisms are injected in a platform (world), where the user has the ability to use a configuration panel on the GUI that allows them user to change at the randomness of the placement of organisms, the number of organims injected in the world, or the percent probability of the bit representation in the genome of the offspring being flipped, thus affecting the evolution of the program.

The program showcases organims that attempt to solve 5 different tasks: (1) Finding a square, (2) Finding a cube, (3) Finding a square root, (4) Finding a cubic root, (5) Finding a cosine. The organisms are rewarded different amounts of points for each different task solved; and, whenever they reach 20 points, they are allowed to reproduce and inject a new offspring into the world (hence simulating evolution).

Finally, the tasks solved are outlined by the organisms taking different colors when they have accomplished different tasks: (1) blue for square, (2) red for cube, (3) yellow for square root, (4) green for cubic root, (5) purple for cosine.
